Removing duplicates values using a for loop

This is a project I completed while learning Python. Given the following list of numbers:

 Values = [1, 9, 10, 12, 14, 1, 2, 3, 17, 5, 7, 10, 10, 1, 18, 3, 9, 11,6,13,12, 20, 4, 17, 15]

I wrote a program that uses a for loop to iterate through the list, filter out duplicate values, and store the unique numbers in a new list called Values2. The final output displays the unique values.
